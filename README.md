## Forecasting Using LSTM, Random Forests, and ARIMA

This project explores forecasting techniques using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Random Forests, and ARIMA models. The goal is to predict future values based on historical data using three different approaches: deep learning, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

# Project Overview

LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep learning model used for sequence prediction, especially in time series forecasting.
Random Forest Regressor: A machine learning model that uses an ensemble of decision trees to predict numerical values.
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average): A classical statistical model for time series forecasting that leverages past data to make predictions.

# Requirements

The following libraries are needed to run the project:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
statsmodels
keras
tensorflow
openpyxl (Optional, for Excel data)
You can install the dependencies using:



# Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/zenithbhatt/credit-card-lstm-arima-rf

Load and preprocess the data in the data/ directory (e.g., Excel file).

Train and evaluate the models (ARIMA, Random Forest, and LSTM) using the forecasting.py script.

Compare model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Visualize the results.

# Conclusion

This project provides a comparative analysis of three popular forecasting techniques. Each model's performance is evaluated, helping to determine which method works best for time series forecasting based on the given dataset.
